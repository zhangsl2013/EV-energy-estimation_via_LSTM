# EV-energy-estimation_via_LSTM

This repository show how electric vehicle energy consumption can be predicted using the deep learning model of LSTM.

Specifically, the file "LSTM_regression.m" trains the LSTM model parameters, while the file "LSTM_regression_test.m" verifies the trained model using the testing dataset.

Both the training data set and the testing data set are from the open data of "Battery and Heating Data in Real Driving Cycles"*
